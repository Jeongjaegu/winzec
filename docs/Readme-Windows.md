# [ZCash](https://z.cash/)[®](#disclaimer) Desktop GUI Wallet - for Windows

ZCash for Windows is not yet officially supported. 
Thanks to [@radix42](https://github.com/radix42) an experimental build has been provided.
Before installing the GUI wallet on Windows you need to install ZCash on Windows.

1. Installing ZCash on Windows

   The easiest way to install it is to use the binary version provided by [@radix42](https://github.com/radix42):

   1.1. Download the ZCash node [ZCash-v1.0.6b.zip](https://zcash.dl.mercerweiss.com/zcash-v1.0.6b.zip)

   1.2. Unzip the file so that the executables `zcashd.exe` and `zcash-cli.exe` are in one directory.
   
   1.3. Download the [ZCash Proving Key](https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-proving.key)
        and store it in directory `%APPDATA%\ZcashParams`.
        
   1.4. Download the [ZCash Verifying Key](https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-verifying.key)
        and store it in directory `%APPDATA%\ZcashParams`.
        
   After downloading the two keys, they should be available in the same directory similar to:

   1.5. Create directory `%APPDATA%\Zcash` and a text file `zcash.conf` in it with the following content:
   ```
   addnode=mainnet.z.cash
   rpcuser=username
   rpcpassword=SomePassword_PleaseChangeThisValue   
   ```

2. Installing the ZCash Desktop GUI wallet

   2.1. Install JDK 8 for Windows - e.g. [use this good tutorial](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-the-Java-Software-Development-Kit)

   2.2. You may use the [latest binary release of the ZCash Desktop GUI wallet](https://github.com/vaklinov/zcash-swing-wallet-ui/releases/latest).
   Download file [ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar](https://github.com/vaklinov/zcash-swing-wallet-ui/releases/download/0.62-beta/ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar)
   and place it in the same folder as `zcashd.exe` and `zcash-cli.exe`. The result needs to be similar to:

4. Running the installed ZCash GUI wallet

   The wallet GUI is a Java program packaged as an executable JAR file. It may be run from command line or started from another GUI tool 
   (e.g. file manager). One way to run it from command line is:
   ```
   java -jar ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   You may instead just use Windows the file manager and double-click on the `ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar`. 
   This will start the ZCash GUI wallet.

### Known issues and limitations

1. Issue: Wallet versions 0.58 and below, when running on Windows systems with (typically non-western) locales that
redefine the decimal point in the Windows locale settings, have problems with updating the GUI wallet state. 
A workaround is to change the Windows [locale settings](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/optics/5-1-2/Optics4.jpg) to have dot as decimal separator.
1. Limitation: Wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in ZCash due to stability problems. A corresponding issue 
[#1552](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1552) has been opened by the ZCash developers. Correspondingly
wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in the ZCash Desktop GUI Wallet.
1. Issue: the GUI wallet does not work correctly if zcashd is started with a custom data directory, like:
`zcashd -datadir=/home/data/whatever` This will be fixed in later versions.
1. Issue: GUI data tables (transactions/addresses etc.) allow copying of data via double click but also allow editing. 
The latter needs to be disabled. 
1. Limitation: The list of transactions does not show all outgoing ones (specifically outgoing Z address 
transactions). A corresponding issue [#1438](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1438) has been opened 
for the ZCash developers.
